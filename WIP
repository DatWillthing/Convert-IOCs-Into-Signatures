Can we make it run where you do the script with the file after it?
  In the powershell console...
    CreateSignatures.ps1 <file>
  #basically you can drag and drop the file here and the whole path should show up
  #basically your script would be shortened to:
    $File = "$1"
  #this is because the dropped file is considered arguement 1
  #After that, detect the file extension...
  #if there is .xlsx then do the excel shit
  #if it is CSV, then good to go
