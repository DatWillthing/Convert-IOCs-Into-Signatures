## Powershell-Project

<i>This is the working directory for the project. The actual code that should be used is all contained within the "SignatureBuilder" directory. Copy the entire "SignatureBuilder" directory and all of its contents in order to use the script within.</i>

The objective is to be able to ingest Excel or CSV files full of threat signatures in order to produce usable rulesets. Currently, we are focusing on producing Suricata/Snort rules, but hope to work on Yara rules and others in the future...
